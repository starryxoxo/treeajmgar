All files must have the same pattern for pathfinding.

This often includes serveral namespaces, filename and content.

In general, the path should be
- index/basebook("spine")

Which basebook or the spine contains:
 - bookInfo (file)
 - bookContent (folder), ending in ch
 - bookAssets ("stor",folder), storage for the folder itself.

The "book" can be shortened.

If a book is unfinished, they are part of the root, where the files begin at spine level.

All previous books aren't required to switch to this pattern.
