# Love Letter 01
**By:** anonymous
**To:** 547

Just so you know, I've ridiculously liked you for years. It may not seem like it, but I guess that's what's make you so special to me. I have felt countless butterflies just by facing you in a daily basis. And, to be awfully honest, I don't want to end this. You've always made me smile, and at the same time, you made me feel things that I wasn't supposed to.

How much longer do you plan on keeping your mouth shut? You circle around me, and I'm so dizzy now. My chest hurts from the thought of you, both in a good and bad way. I remember two years back that our eyes met, it made my heart skip a beat. A classic cliche.

Look: I don't believe in love at first sight. But you make it difficult for me to ignore that such thing actually exists. I want us to grow together, not just endlessly run in hopeless circles. I continue to fear that someday, you'll lose your interest on me.

As time goes by, I learned one thing, and it's along the lines "I like you".

But those three words are far too short to describe my feelings for you.

Those three words are far too vague to even describe what emotion I feel when I think of you.

Those three words *alone* is not enough, and even Cupid agrees.

My time here is wasted when I'm without you. I want to spend my whole life with you, but oh well. You've made me a better person, but I'm sure you don't know that.

And so, I hope this letter finds you. Finds the best in both of us, knowing we'll just hide what we feel in the shadows.

**Thanks, 547**.
