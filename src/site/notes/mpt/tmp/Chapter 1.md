# Chapter 1 — Petals by the Flower

Just like anyone else in this world, I was born by my father and mother.

***
![1tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/1tmp.jpg)
![2tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/2tmp.jpg)

Although, my mother hated my gender. She's always saying I'd be weak and unfit for the job of a spy.

##### 22 years later...

![6tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/6tmp.jpg)

***
This is Jino, one of my best friends. We've known each other long enough to act like siblings.
***

I took a brief moment to chill... and yes, I *did* arrive. While going through the back, Jino stared at me going in while the professor was taking his sweet time telling his love story.

I sat down next to Jino, breathing like a dinosaur that ended the run in that browser game.

![7tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/7tmp.jpg)
![8tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/8tmp.jpg)

Jino laughed the joke off, but I stared at him with disappointment. The professor then started taking attendance the moment I sat down and *voila*, I learned *nothing* after the lecture was dismissed.

Oh well, psychology. Roccini in its finest.

"Why take psychology?" you might ask.

Not me—but I have no choice. Both in Roccini quarters where I live and here in college takes me back to taking psychology. They're being engrained to me to be more of a spy.

Since dad has never quit on me, I try my best.

I'm great at being a psycho though, but it's simultaneously a love-hate relationship. *Psycho*, got it?
(laugh, reader.)

Worse, I have Calculus for *some* reason. I think I'm gonna fail this semester...

![9tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/9tmp.jpg)

We started walking to go to our next lecture. I was wondering why Jino wasn't behind me.

![10tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/10tmp.jpg)
![11tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/11tmp.jpg)

Sounds reasonable.

##### After Calculus, 2:00 PM

![12tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/12tmp.jpg)

Someone wrapped their arm around my neck so sudden. I looked around and it was Noa.
Noa's the youngest in our circle.

![13tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/13tmp.jpg)
![14tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/14tmp.jpg)
![15tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/15tmp.jpg)
![a storage/16tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/16tmp.jpg)

Jino turned to me and asked if I wanted to go home.

![17tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/17tmp.jpg)

I straight up ate that ramyeon with no hesitation. I feel a wee bit sorry, but... I feel refreshed.

Jino and I went home after.
Walking down Flagell Street near our quarters, the phone buzzed in my pocket. Good thing I didn't forget my phone.

![18tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/18tmp.jpg)

"Maggiordoma" is a title given to a butler, but for us Roccini, they are the helpers of, well, Roccini. I am not sure why the title, but I am sure it's Italian. The actual history of the title may be far more complex than I imagine.

Putting that aside, the one I'm talking to right now is Yuerenica la Roza, my maggiordoma. Basically, we are partners in crime, literally.

We're the best of friends since we have known each other since birth. Can you guess who's older of the two of us?
