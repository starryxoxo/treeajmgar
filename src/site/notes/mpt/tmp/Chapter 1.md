# Chapter 1 — Petals by the Flower

Just like anyone else in this world, I was born by my father and mother.

Although, my mother hated my gender, saying I'd be weak and unfit for the job of a spy.

##### 22 years later...

This is Jino, one of my best friends. We've known each other long enough to act like siblings.

I took a brief moment to chill... and yes, I *did* arrive. Jake stared at me going in through the back entrance with the professor taking his sweet time telling his love story.

I sat down next to Jino, breathing like a dinosaur that ended the run in that browser game.

Jino just laughed the joke off, but I stared at him with the disappointed emoji. The professor then started taking attendance and *voila*, I learned *nothing* after the lecture was dismissed.

Oh well, psychology. Roccini in its finest.

"Why take psychology?" you might ask.
You're in for a ride now aren't 'ya?

Not me—but I have no choice. Both in Roccini quarters where I live and here in college takes be back to taking psychology. They're engrained to me forever. Since dad has never quit on me, I try my best at it.

I'm great at *it* though, but I have a love-hate relationship with it.

Worse, I have Calculus for *some* reason. I think I'm gonna fail this semester...

![9tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/9tmp.jpg)

We started walking to go to our next lecture. I was wondering why Jino wasn't behind me.

![11tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/11tmp.jpg)

Sounds reasonable.

##### After Calculus, 2:00 PM

![12tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/12tmp.jpg)

Someone wrapped their arm around my neck so sudden. I looked around and it was Noa.
Noa's the youngest in our circle.

![13tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/13tmp.jpg)

![15tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/15tmp.jpg)
![a storage/16tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/16tmp.jpg)

Jino turned to me and asked if I want to go home.

![17tmp.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/17tmp.jpg)

I slurped that ramyeon. I feel a wee bit sorry, but hey, I feel refreshed.

We both went home after eating. As I was walking down Flagell Street near our mansion, someone I don't know messaged me on the phone.
