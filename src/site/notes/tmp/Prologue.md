# Prologue

Time is a strange thing, isn't it? People claim time heals everything. So why am I covered in blood right now? A war between two hearts. Our lives have been linked, like threads sewn together. We hang by a single, sharp metal wire that keeps us alive. I can't touch it. I warned myself it would cut me deep. It's a thread that will make my finger bleed if I dare get close.

I've become fragile, like glass. Something felt very wrong inside. It felt broken.

Like a river lost in time, I can't tell what's real. I can no longer separate our realities from my dreams every night. I wished you wouldn't regret knowing me. But in the end, you do. It's me you resent.

Father always gave in to greed. He only cared about himself.

I raised the gun *just meters away*. My eyes felt like I was in Atlantic Ocean. I was freezing and drowning, unable to get any air.
