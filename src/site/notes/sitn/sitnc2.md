After thinking na puntahan si Jay sa classroom niya, biglang dumating yung kasunod na teacher namin kaya umupo nalang ako sa upuan ko.

##### After 2nd Period
*Ang tagal naman ng oras... gusto ko nang umuwi...*

Over time, mas naging close and fond ako kay Jay. Honestly—he's not spoiled at all. At first, kala ko spoiled but it's the *complete* opposite. He cooks, he washes the dishes, nagwawalis and so much more!

Oh—nakalimutan ko bang sabihin—?

It's been 5 months with Jay. Nagpaalam na kami sa parents namin, and they approved. Ang saya pa nga ni mama nung nakita niya si Jay.

*Someone like Jay was her dream son-in-law. Masipag na, gwapo pa.* And no one's in a bad side, so it's a win-win.

And that, brings us to now.

Pagkauwi ko ng bahay nagpaalam ako kay Mama na lalabas lang kami ni Jay para mag-date.

*"Ma, lalabas lang kami ni Jay!"*
*"Una niyo yang labas ah. Sige, payag ako basta mag-iingat lang kayo."* Sabay payag ni mama sa'kin.
"Opo ma." Sagot ko sakanya.

As minutes passed, I took the time to change my clothes. In a sudden, our doorbell rang. It was Jay, as expected.

*"Anak, si Jay narito na!"* 
Sigaw ni mama sa baba.

Pinapasok ni Mama si Jay at pinaupo sa sofa ng aming sala.
Di ako makababa since this is our **first date**. *Natural blush 'to.*

After a few seconds of hesitation, nagbaba na ako. Our eyes met at a glance, but I immediately looked away.

It was undoubtedly a wonderful night. We went shopping, eating, strolling and so much more. I wished time would stop but it kept going. It's just *so nice* to be with you.

Obviously, it was a brag with them lol.

After we ate, we got out of the restaurant and walked our way to our school. I wondered what's with the school for us to go.

We arrived and went to the place where he confessed to me.
*"Close your eyes first."*  Jay mumbled, looking left and right.
*"Why are we here?"*  I asked.
*"Nothing. Just, close your eyes."*

I closed my eyes for a few seconds. I could hear him preparing for something.

*"Okay, open your eyes."* said Jay.

The moment I opened my eyes, Jay was kneeling on his knee, holding a box with his hands.

*"Will you be my girlfriend, Althea?"* asked Jay as he opened the box, embarrassed, but with a tinge of confidence.

*"It's already this late, but I won't mind being with you for longer."* I looked at Jay.
*"Of course, I want to be your one and only, Jay."*  I answered.

He was excited but couldn't let out a scream as we were at school. Jay held my hand and let the ring go by my finger.

As he held my hand slowly pushing the ring into my finger, *"I was enchanted to know you,"* he said.

*"I like you, no, **I love you, Althea**. I hope that we'll have more memories to make."*  Jay whispered with a flustered face.

I took a picture of our hands with the rings together.
*"I'll be sure to get a second ring, Jay."* I said.

As the night fell, he walked me to my home and said his goodbyes. Then, Jay walked his way home.

##### 11:30 PM

I have been waiting for hours, waiting for a notification from Jay. 

I received a message. But it wasn't Jay...

*May nangyari ba? Galit ba siya? Why did she message me?*

**It was her mom.**

![sitn56.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/sitn56.jpg)

*... There's no way, please... huwag lang itong iniisip ko.* 

![sitn57.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/sitn57.jpg)

*I was right...*
Looking at these messages, I couldn't see my phone in front of me. *My tears were awfully burning my eyes.*

*What do I do now?...*

![sitn58.jpg](/img/user/a%20storage/sitn58.jpg)

I rushed downstairs, my legs trembling and my eyes red-colored. Nakita ako ni mamang naiyak and she immediately came to hug me.

*"Anak, ba't ka naiyak? May nangyari ba?"*
*"Ang ganda pa naman ng ring mo."*  she said.

*"Mama... si Jay..."* I sobbed, crying even harder... **I couldn't speak at all**.

Pinaupo muna ako ni mama sa upuan. She got me a glass of water and some tissue.

*"Anak, kahit ano man ang nangyari, pwede mong sabihin sa akin."*
*"Mama... nasagasaan po si Jay..."*

Nagulat si mama sa sinabi ko. She rushed to ask, but then later slowed down. *"Saan siya ngayon? Pwede ba nating puntahan? Okay lang ba siya?"*

*"Tara, pupuntahan natin anak."*

I gave her the hospital he's staying in. She packed my things and we immediately went to the hospital.

***

Nakarating kami sa ospital pero takot pa rin ako.

So many thoughts were circling my head at the time, but I focused on Jay... that he was fine... that **he was okay**.

We entered the room where Jay was staying. I saw him lying on the bed full of blood stains and undoubtedly in pain.

I sat down next to him and held his hands.
*"Okay ka lang ba, Jay?"* I asked.

But he didn't answer.
A tear came down my face.

*"Tanda mo pa ba ako, Jay?"*
He woke up and looked at me, moving strained.

I didn't expect his reaction to be... so fierce. He asked me to let go of his hand, and I did.

Malungkot na tumingin sa'kin si mama.
*"Wala ka bang magagawa d'yan, iha? Sigurado akong matatandaan ka ni Jay."* sabi niya sakin, while holding my other hand.
*"Bukas nalang, ma."* sabi ko.

###### The End
Jay never woke up the next day. I suppose he is resting now.

Looking at his deathbed surrounded by flowers, thinking of what we could have been together, I came to see Ethan looking at me weirdly, as if satisfied of something. That, I didn't bother with, until...
