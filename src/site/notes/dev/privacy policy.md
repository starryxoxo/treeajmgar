### No Personal Data Collection
TSL is committed to protecting your privacy. We want to be transparent and clear: we do not collect, store, or process any personal data from visitors or users of our Service.

- We do **not** collect IP addresses, device identifiers, or any usage analytics.
- We do **not** share or sell any data to third parties because we do not have any data to share.

### Use of Third-Party Services
External links (such as YouTube Music) or any other third-party services may use cookies collect personal data, in which TSL does not have control over.
