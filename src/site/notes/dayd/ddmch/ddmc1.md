it was a long day for jake. they're finishing up the school year and finally graduating in two months. college life is near, and jake isn't particularly hyped up about it.

he still isn't done with things he needs to do. may project pa sila and they want it to be done already.

"is there something i can do?" jake sighed, asking daniel with a quiet song playing in the background as the group does their project. the other gave him a piece of paper, a form.

"sagutan mo yan. di ko pala na-fill out kanina." he continued cutting cardboards for the project.

"okay." he looked down the paper. "ballpen please." riki handed him a pen.

"thanks." he started filling out the form when it suddenly started to pour outside.

jake paused. *wow, it's already rain season.* he thought as the heavy raindrops fall on the ground.

*yet, i still haven't told him somehow.*

<p style="text-align:center;">+++++</p>

daniel turned to jake. "tapos ka na ba? 6 copies yan, meron pa dito."

"ha?!" jake exclaimed. "isang page pa lang 'tong nafifill-up-an ko. ano ba yan."

"kaya nga bilisan mo na jan." daniel handed him the other 6 copies of the form.

"why do we even need this much?" jake asked, hurriedly answering the forms.

"i'll save one from those. souvenir ng sulat mo." jake was confused from his reply, so he just ignored it and started filling out the forms again.

"joke lang. maganda sulat mo eh. anyway it's for all of us. extra copy." the boy continued his work. riki and jaehyun doing their respective works too.

"oh. okay." jake went back to answering the forms.

*i'm kinda hungry.*

"gusto niyo ba ng pagkain? i'm gonna buy sa labas." jake stood up and asked. "can i, daniel?"

"go. criss cross akin." he answered. "coke, tas vcut daw kay jaehyun." riki added.

jake got his umbrella and went out to buy from the convenience store. it was already <u>11:30 pm</u>. it wasn't dark because of the streetlights so jake didn't bother.

he arrived after three minutes of walking under the rain. *damn i'm tired. now where's the vcut?*

jake went hectic when he couldn't find the vcut. after a long search, he finally found the vcut

"oh, it's here." he brought all the other foods the others requested, including his, at the cashier and paid for it.

*should i just ask them to pay me or not? 'wag na.*

walking back to daniel's house, he admired the shooting stars that passed by above his head.

the city lights were dim enough for stars to be seen this night.

*it would've been nice with you.* jake chuckled at the thought.

his phone went buzzing from all the messages, his groupmates were worried he might've been kidnapped.

jake arrived at the house. it's already <u>11:47pm?</u> 

"tapos na ba tayo?" jake asked his groupmates. putting his umbrella outside the door.

"yup. i'll be doing the finishing touches." said daniel, painting the sides of the model of a house they made.

"wow, can i help?" jake sat down, handing everyone their snacks. daniel nodded at his question.

"sure, but don't be too late, kahit friday na."
"yes sir." jake sarcastically replied.

"bye dan, aalis na kami." riki and jaehyun bid their goodbyes to daniel and jake.
"ingat." daniel replied as jake waved to them.

the other two left, only daniel and jake are working together for the project.

*it's so relaxing in here just painting the walls of this small house. i wish this atmosphere stays forever.*

*honestly, i didn't expect them to finish it this early. i thought they'd finish at two or something.*

"ba't nga pala antagal mo kanina?" daniel asked, painting the walls of the model he made earlier.

"i couldn't find the vcut." jake shared, the boy just chuckled at him.

"ba't di mo tinanong sa staff??" daniel stared at jake, holding his laugh.

"i couldn't. only the cashier was there, i had no choice. also cuz i'm shy...?" he jokingly said. dan chuckled at him, hitting him hard on the back.

silence enveloped between the two for a short minute as they finish their project.

daniel looked at him, "thanks for the design of the house by the way."
"hmm? oh yeah." jake replied.

<p style="text-align:center;">+++++</p>

*what a boring night.*

jake checked his phone and saw that someone texted him.

*or... probably not?*

"hey dan, i'll be leaving soon. sunghoon will pick me up."

"yeah, sure." daniel replied. "pagpatuloy mo muna yan bago ka umalis." jake nodded.

"yung forms nga pala. you can fill them up once you get home." daniel handed him the other copies of the form placed on the side of the table.

"yep." jake took the forms from daniel's hands and put them in his bag.
