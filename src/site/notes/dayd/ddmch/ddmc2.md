<u>12:11am</u>

"wala pa ba?" daniel asked jake.
"wala pa. maybe it's cause of the traffic." jake answered.

"for now, let me do these first." jake pointed at the small trees and bushes surrounding the house.

"luh, wag na. akin nalang yan. pack your things na, baka biglang dumating si sunghoon." daniel declined at the offer.

jake sat down and packed his things, preparing for sunghoon to arrive.

a notification buzzed from his phone when he grabbed it to text sunghoon to ask where he is now.

![5ddm.webp](/img/user/dayd/ddmstor/5ddm.webp)

the doorbell rang from the inside of the house.

"let me get it." daniel stood up and opened the door.

"i'll pick jake up, you guys done?" sunghoon looked at daniel.

"yup. ako na magtatapos nung ilan, heh."

"you really like doing that stuff huh? well, we're going now. bye" sunghoon hugged jake's shoulder as he went closer by the door. he grabbed jake's bag and carried it to the car.

"ingat kayo!" daniel said quietly, waving at them as he close the door.

sunghoon opened jake's side of the car and let him inside. after him, he went inside as well.

"where muna tayo?" sunghoon asked jake, turning the car key to on.

"let's go 7/11 first." jake answered, pulling his seatbelt down.

"okay, let's go there then. want a detour first?" sunghoon looked at jake.

"no prob, is jay still unprepared??" jake replied.

"i don't know. bahala siya, as long as he's prepared once we get there." sunghoon said. he started driving to 7/11, which was far from where they are.

"110??? ang tagal pa." sunghoon said as he stopped one second before red light.

jake put on his earphones and started listening to his favorite tunes, while sunghoon looked at him.

"just tell me when we get there." jake asked of sunghoon as he rolled the seat down.

"yes po your majesty." sunghoon jokingly replied.

<p style="text-align:center;">+++++</p>

jake admired the stars once again from the inside of the car. he's always liked the stars—they were like flowers to him. the twinkling of those meant they swayed by the universe's breeze, just dancing up there in the sky.

for him, it meant something deep. his mother always told him to look at the skies when he needed help and courage. she mentioned the stars would guide him.

the stars reminded him of his mother. even though she's far away for now, he still hasn't forgotten about her.

<p style="text-align:center;">+++++</p>

sunghoon looked at jake when he noticed him sniffing from the side.

"hoy ba't ka naiyak??" sunghoon hurriedly asked jake. he held onto jake's arm, asking for explanation of his tears.

he took jake's earphones out of his ear, "have a break first. here, some water." the other gave him a bottle of water before jake spoke.

"nothing. i just miss my mom." the younger handed him tissues from the car drawer. jake took them and wiped his tears with it.

"sorry about that." jake sat straight.

"why are you apologizing? it's fine." sunghoon smiled at him and started to drive again.

<p style="text-align:center;">+++++</p>
both arrived at 7/11 after a long chill ride.

<u>12:54am</u>
"bruh, how do you always make me feel hungry?" jake grunted as he got out of the car after sunghoon.

the two went inside the store. jake grabbed a cart for the things they'll buy.

"stop taking pictures of me, will you?" jake sighed at sunghoon, continuing to search the aisle for snacks he might want to eat later.

"sorry, i can't." sunghoon smiled at him. *he's too cute.*

"do you want softdrinks?" sunghoon asked jake, taking two cokes from the fridge.

"no. get me a mogu-mogu instead." jake replied.

"grape flavored?" sunghoon put the coke on the cart jake's holding.

"you already know." jake walked to other aisles and sunghoon just watched him collect items like pokemon.

"is that all?" sunghoon looked at the cart—it's full already.
"yup. you can afford it, i'm sure."

sunghoon sighed and went to the cashier with the cart, while jake went inside the car to relax.

he opened his phone to take a peek at the clock.

<u>1:15am.</a>

*wow, i took really long picking stuff there.*

sunghoon finally got out of the store. jake turned around and helped him get the paper bag full of snacks and drinks into the car.

"bro ang dami." sunghoon huffed at jake. he just laughed it off. the two hopped inside the car to go to their next stop—jay's house.

<p style="text-align:center;">+++++</p>

"can you text jay for me?" sunghoon said as he steer the vehicle.

"yeah sure, but my phone's dead. can i have yours instead?" jake pulled out his hand out of his pocket to reach for sunghoon's phone.

sunghoon gave him his phone and jake managed to open it.

*still the same password.*

jake accidentally clicked sunghoon's gallery, full of jake's pictures when they were in the store.

*what in the hell is this atmosphere?* sunghoon thought as jake glared at him when he saw his pictures.

"what is this??? i'll delete this you mf." jake threatened sunghoon, pointing his finger at the screen showing hoon's gallery.

"oh..." sunghoon slowly turned to jake.

"did i take too much?" sunghoon chuckled.

*this... bruh. you're really laughing right now???*

"parang gusto mong ma-delete ah." jake said. the younger pulled the car aside the road and took the phone from jake's hand.

"nope, i'll keep it." sunghoon played with jake.

*what's the deal with this guy? ugh, fine. keep it then.* jake faced the other side of the car.

"i already texted jay. we're going to pick him up as i said earlier." sunghoon noticed jake replied with pure silence and turned to him.

"aww, are you having a tantrum?" sunghoon jokingly said, jake became annoyed and gave him a glare again.

<p style="text-align:center;">++ at jay's house ++</p>

*was this a good idea in the first place? why is it like this? sana kunin na ako ni Lord, why is this happening to me???* jake was stuck with sunghoon in the elevator of jay's house.

it was the unbreakable silence that jake hated. *if only i didn't act like that earlier, would sunghoon not give me these hopeless glances? besides, it wasn't that serious...*

the elevator felt so slow. it was like two minutes, *for jake.* when the doors of the elevator finally opened, jay was already facing them.

"sorry, pababa na sana ako pero naunahan n'yo ako. let's go." jay said to the two in front of him. jake didn't say a word and just sighed.

the three got down and proceeded to go to jake's apartment. the ride was long enough plus the traffic. the city is still busy—it always is.

<u>1:45am</u>

"took us long enough." sunghoon murmured as jake opened the door of his apartment.

"what do you expect? this is a city." jake replied, while jay just straight up went inside the room.

"matutulog pa ba tayo? look at the clock. not much time." jay sighed, tired from the ride.

jake closed the door and went to his room searching for his charger. he found it on his desk and immediately went to charge his phone. he went out just to see the two lounging at his couch.

"maglinis muna kayo ng katawan, no outside clothes." jake mentioned as he glared at the two. they quickly got their towels to take a shower.

"oh ako nanalo, me first." sunghoon said after winning rock-paper-scissors with jay. he sat down on the floor as sunghoon go inside the bathroom.

![8ddm.webp](/img/user/dayd/ddmstor/8ddm.webp)

while jay was strumming his guitar, he played jake's favorite song.

"you still know that?" jake looked at jay playing with his guitar.

"natandaan ko lang." he continued to play the song. sunghoon finally finished, and jay put the guitar in the bag where he got it from.

while jay was taking a shower, sunghoon offered jake to eat with him. he sat beside him and opened one of the snacks sunghoon bought earlier.

"nag-toothbrush ka na though." jake said. sunghoon shook his head.

"i don't mind." he said as he munched his food.

<p style="text-align:center;">+++++</p>

it's already <u>3:00am</u>, everyone's fallen asleep. jake couldn't sleep so he went outside for a moment.

*the air feels so nice.*

*why can't i fall asleep? i'm  already so exhausted... just let me sleep.*

jake enjoyed the peacefulness he's calmly intaking, until someone spoke from behind.
